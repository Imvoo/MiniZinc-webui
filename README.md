# MiniZinc-webui
## Requirements
- Node-js
- npm

## Getting Started
1. Install node-js (https://nodejs.org/en/).
    - This should come with npm (node package manager).
    - If it doesn't, https://github.com/npm/npm has installation instructions for most operating systems.
2. In the directory, run `npm install`.
3. After installing, run `npm start` to start the React server.
    - The server should be located at http://localhost:3000 by default.
    - This server auto reloads on changes and logs errors in the console.
4. Edit files in src/\*.js.

## Notes
This was started with Facebook's create-react-app (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
